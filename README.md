## :mag_right: About
This web was designed to calculate DRI (detection/recognition/identification) ranges and other performance data for a variety
of cameras, by using Nyquist formulas.
In order to calculate performance the user is required to insert the following values: sensor pitch, sensor size in px (width x height)
and lens focal length. In return, the application will calculate respective FOV dimensions as well as geometrical DRI for various target 
sizes.
Default values of target size and line-pairs can be configured through the settings.
